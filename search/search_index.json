Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable CGI script without authentication, injecting malicious commands that execute with root privileges on the underlying Linux system. The vulnerability is compounded by CVE-2023-52164, an arbitrary file read flaw, allowing attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data including credentials and configuration files. CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) confirmed active exploitation, adding CVE-2023-52163 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on December 2024. The DS-2105 Pro NVR is end-of-life (EoL) and no longer supported by Digiever, meaning no security patches will be released. Threat actors are leveraging the vulnerability to deploy Mirai and ShadowV2 botnet malware, conscripting NVRs into DDoS armies and using compromised devices as pivot points for lateral movement into enterprise and operational technology (OT) networks.

Instead, attackers trick victims into authorizing the device link themselves through sophisticated social engineering tactics. Victims receive messages appearing to come from known contacts with enticing content (e.g., \"Hi, check this photo\"), leading to fake verification pages that mimic Facebook/WhatsApp interfaces. Users unknowingly enter pairing codes that grant the attacker's device real-time access to all WhatsApp chats, media, and contacts. Once linked, the attacker's session behaves as a legitimate authorized device, allowing persistent access while victims continue using WhatsApp normally, often remaining unaware of the compromise.

exploiting a five-year-old authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN that allows attackers to circumvent two-factor authentication (2FA) and gain unauthorized access to protected VPN endpoints. CVE-2020-12812 is an improper authentication flaw where FortiOS treats usernames as case-sensitive, while LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directories typically are case-insensitive. This discrepancy creates an authentication logic flaw: when attackers submit valid credentials with altered username casing (e.g., \"Admin\" instead of \"admin\"), FortiOS fails to match the local user account (which has 2FA enabled) and instead falls back to LDAP authentication, which does not enforce 2FA. The vulnerability affects misconfigured FortiGate devices where local users with 2FA are linked to LDAP, and the same users exist in LDAP groups configured in authentication policies for SSL VPN or IPsec VPN. Despite being patched in 2020, the flaw remains exploited in 2025 due to widespread unpatched deployments and persistent misconfigurations. Fortinet has issued warnings about active exploitation in the wild, with attackers leveraging the bypass to gain VPN access, administrative privileges, and establish persistence for lateral movement within enterprise networks.

Node that uses Pyodide (WebAssembly-based Python runtime) for executing Python code within workflows. The sandbox, intended to isolate Python code execution and prevent system-level access, contains bypassable restrictions that permit malicious code injection to break out of the isolated environment and execute OS-level shell commands with the same privileges as the n8n process (often running as root or administrative user in containerized deployments). </p> <p>With a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical), the vulnerability requires only authenticated access and workflow create/modify permissions\u2014privileges commonly granted to legitimate n8n users for automation development. Attackers can craft malicious workflows containing Python Code Nodes with sandbox escape payloads that invoke system commands via Python's <code>os.system()</code>, <code>subprocess</code>, or similar APIs that should be blocked but are accessible due to incomplete sandbox isolation. </p> <p>The vulnerability affects n8n versions \u2265 1.0.0 and &lt;

Policy Organizations","text":"<p>APT28 GRU Russia Credential Theft Spearphishing Phishing Energy Sector</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/APT28/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>APT28 (also tracked as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, Pawn Storm, Forest Blizzard, Strontium), a Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Unit 26165 of the Russian Federation, has launched a sophisticated credential harvesting campaign targeting energy companies, policy research organizations, defense contractors, and technology firms across Europe, North America, and Turkey. </p> <p>This campaign represents a tactical refinement of traditional phishing techniques, leveraging region-specific and sector-specific lures combined with disposable web infrastructure to evade detection while maximizing victim credibility and success rates. Unlike malware-based attacks that risk detection by endpoint security solutions, APT28's current approach focuses exclusively on social engineering and credential theft, exploiting the human element as the weakest link in organizational security.</p> <p>The campaign employs spearphishing emails meticulously crafted to match the professional interests and responsibilities of targeted individuals\u2014energy policy analysts receive documents on \"EU Energy Security Framework,\" think tank researchers get \"NATO Strategic Policy Updates,\" and defense contractors see \"Classified Procurement Guidelines.\" These emails contain shortened URLs (using services like bit.ly, TinyURL, or custom URL shorteners) that obfuscate the true destination and bypass basic URL reputation checks. When victims click the shortened link, they are redirected through a multi-stage infrastructure utilizing disposable hosting services such as Webhook.site, InfinityFree, Byet Internet Services, and ngrok\u2014platforms offering free anonymous hosting, minimal abuse enforcement, and ephemeral infrastructure that can be abandoned and recreated rapidly to evade blocklists.</p> <p>The phishing workflow follows a carefully choreographed sequence designed to maximize trust and minimize suspicion:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Initial Redirect: Shortened URL redirects to a disposable hosting service displaying a decoy PDF document matching the email's theme (e.g., \"Energy_Policy_Report_2026.pdf\" preview page), establishing credibility by showing the victim exactly what they expected to see.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication Request: After a brief moment (3-5 seconds, mimicking document loading time), the page displays a message such as \"This document requires authentication to access secure content\" or \"Your session has expired. Please sign in to continue,\" then automatically redirects to a fake login portal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Credential Harvesting Page: The phishing page is a pixel-perfect clone of legitimate authentication portals\u2014Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), Google Workspace, Sophos VPN login, or organization-specific SSO portals. These pages feature valid HTTPS certificates (using Let's Encrypt or stolen/compromised certificates), corporate logos, correct color schemes, and familiar UI elements to appear completely legitimate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Exfiltration: When victims enter their credentials (username, password, and in some cases, MFA codes or tokens), JavaScript embedded in the phishing page immediately transmits the captured data via hidden POST requests or WebSocket connections to attacker-controlled webhook endpoints (e.g., Webhook.site collectors, attacker C2 servers, or cloud storage buckets). Some variants also capture session cookies, OAuth tokens, and device fingerprinting data to enable more sophisticated account takeover.</p> </li> <li> <p>Silent Redirect: After credential submission, victims are seamlessly redirected to the legitimate authentication portal (real Microsoft login, actual corporate VPN page, etc.). Since many users have auto-saved credentials or SSO configured, they successfully authenticate on the legitimate site and assume the first login attempt was simply a temporary glitch or that they mistyped their password\u2014no red flags, no suspicion.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This approach is particularly effective because:</p> <ul> <li>No malware installation required: Bypasses antivirus, EDR, and application whitelisting controls entirely</li> <li>Disposable infrastructure: Phishing pages are hosted on free services that can be abandoned within hours after use, making blocklisting ineffective</li> <li>Localized lures: Sector-specific and region-specific themes increase credibility and victim compliance rates</li> <li>Shortened URLs: Obfuscate destination domains, preventing URL reputation analysis before click</li> <li>Legitimate post-authentication: Victims successfully log into real services after credential theft, eliminating suspicion</li> <li>Credential reuse: Stolen credentials often work across multiple systems due to password reuse and SSO integration</li> </ul> <p>APT28 specifically targets high-value individuals and organizations involved in:</p> <ul> <li>Energy Sector: European energy companies (utilities, pipeline operators, renewable energy firms), Turkish energy infrastructure operators, energy policy analysts, and regulatory agencies</li> <li>Policy &amp; Think Tanks: NATO policy research organizations, EU foreign policy institutes, defense strategy think tanks, Eastern Europe security analysis groups</li> <li>Defense &amp; Aerospace: Defense contractors working on NATO procurement, military technology companies, aerospace firms with government contracts</li> <li>Government: Officials in energy ministries, foreign affairs departments, defense procurement offices, and intelligence liaison roles</li> <li>Technology: Companies providing critical infrastructure software, cybersecurity firms defending energy/government sectors, telecommunications providers</li> </ul> <p>The campaign has been active since late 2025 and continues into January 2026, with peak activity observed targeting Turkish energy organizations (following geopolitical tensions over Black Sea energy routes) and European think tanks (amid ongoing debates over sanctions policy and NATO expansion). Security researchers have identified hundreds of phishing domains and webhook endpoints associated with this campaign, indicating large-scale, systematic targeting rather than opportunistic attacks.</p> <p>The operational objectives include:</p> <ol> <li>Strategic Intelligence Collection: Access to corporate email accounts provides intelligence on energy policy decisions, defense procurement plans, NATO strategy discussions, and sanctions implementation</li> <li>Persistent Access: Stolen VPN credentials and SSO tokens enable long-term access to internal networks and cloud infrastructure</li> <li>Supply Chain Positioning: Compromising technology vendors and contractors creates pathways for future supply chain attacks</li> <li>Geopolitical Advantage: Intelligence on European energy policy and NATO strategy supports Russian foreign policy and military planning</li> </ol> <p>This campaign is not a technical vulnerability or CVE\u2014it is a social engineering attack exploiting human trust, professional context, and organizational security gaps in authentication processes and user awareness training. The sophistication lies not in malware complexity but in operational tradecraft, psychological manipulation, and infrastructure agility.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/APT28/#campaign-specifications","title":"Campaign Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Threat Actor APT28 (Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, Pawn Storm, Forest

Unlike traditional email-based phishing campaigns that rely on mass spam with low success rates, this WhatsApp worm exploits trusted relationships\u2014victims receive malicious messages from known contacts whose accounts have already been compromised, dramatically increasing the likelihood of user interaction and infection. </p> <p>The attack begins when a victim receives a WhatsApp message containing a ZIP archive with a seemingly innocuous filename (e.g., <code>Invoice.zip</code>, <code>Photos.zip</code>, <code>Document.zip</code>) from a contact they trust. Inside the ZIP file is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) disguised with a misleading filename and double-extension trickery (e.g., <code>invoice.pdf.vbs</code> appears as <code>invoice.pdf</code> if Windows file extensions are hidden). When executed, the VBS script initiates a multi-stage infection chain that downloads and deploys two primary payloads: </p> <p>(1) a Python-based propagation module that hijacks the victim's WhatsApp Web session to automatically collect all contacts and send copies of the malicious ZIP file to every contact in the address book, and (2) the Astaroth banking trojan delivered as an MSI installer package that runs silently in the background. The propagation module is particularly insidious\u2014it automates message sending via WhatsApp Web, creating a worm-like self-replicating behavior where each newly infected victim becomes an unwitting distribution node, exponentially amplifying the campaign's reach. </p> <p>The module includes telemetry capabilities that log propagation metrics (messages sent, delivery success rates, messages per minute) back to the attacker's command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, enabling real-time monitoring of the campaign's effectiveness and reach. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Astaroth trojan establishes persistent presence on the victim's system, monitoring browser activity for visits to Brazilian banking websites (Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, Ita\u00fa, Bradesco, Santander, etc.), capturing login credentials, session tokens, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and exfiltrating this data to attacker-controlled servers for fraudulent transactions and account takeovers. </p> <p>Astaroth employs advanced evasion techniques including fileless execution (living-off-the-land binaries), obfuscated scripts, and process injection to evade antivirus detection and maintain stealth. </p> <p>The campaign specifically targets Brazil, leveraging Portuguese-language social engineering lures and knowledge of local banking practices, but the underlying technique\u2014WhatsApp-based worm propagation combined with banking malware\u2014represents a blueprint that can be adapted to target other regions with high WhatsApp adoption (Latin America, Europe, India, Middle East, Africa). </p> <p>The exploitation of WhatsApp Web's interface for automated message sending highlights a critical security gap in how messaging platforms handle automated interactions, as the platform's security controls fail to distinguish between legitimate user actions and script-driven automation. </p> <p>With over 2 billion WhatsApp users globally and particularly high adoption in Brazil (165+ million users), the potential impact of this worm is enormous\u2014a single infected user with 50 contacts can theoretically infect hundreds within hours through cascading propagation.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/Astaroth/#campaign-specifications","title":"Campaign Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Campaign Name Boto Cor-de-Rosa (Pink Dolphin) Malware Family Astaroth (aka Guildma) Malware Type Banking Trojan, Credential Stealer, Information Stealer Propagation Method Self-replicating WhatsApp worm (automated contact messaging) Distribution Vector WhatsApp messages with malicious ZIP attachments Initial Access Social engineering (trusted contact sends malicious file) Target Geography Brazil (primary), potential expansion to other Portuguese-speaking regions Target Sectors Individuals (banking customers), small businesses, enterprises Delivery Mechanism ZIP archive containing VBScript (.vbs file) Payload Stages Multi-stage: VBS \u2192 Python propagation module + Astaroth MSI installer Propagation Platform WhatsApp Web (browser-based WhatsApp interface) Worm Behavior Automated message sending to all WhatsApp contacts Banking Targets Brazilian banks (Banco do Brasil, Caixa, Ita\u00fa, Bradesco, Santander, etc.) Credential Theft Username, password, 2FA codes, session tokens, account numbers Persistence Mechanism Windows Registry Run keys, scheduled tasks, DLL injection Evasion Techniques Fileless execution, LOLBins (BITSAdmin, regsvr32, mshta), obfuscation Telemetry/Metrics Logs propagation success rate, messages per minute, infected contact count Command &amp;

Unlike traditional data breaches involving unauthorized database access, this incident represents a large-scale automated collection of user information through legitimate but abused API calls, systematically harvesting profile metadata that should have been protected through proper access controls. </p> <p>The dataset appeared on dark web marketplaces on January 7, 2026, making the information available to threat actors for phishing campaigns, identity theft, SIM-swapping attacks, and social engineering. Affected users have reported waves of unsolicited password reset emails, suggesting attackers are actively weaponizing the leaked data to trigger legitimate Instagram security features, creating confusion and potential vectors for phishing attacks disguised as official communications. </p> <p>Meta (Instagram's parent company) has denied that any breach of their internal systems occurred, attributing the password reset activity to external parties abusing publicly available account recovery mechanisms using the scraped email/phone combinations. However, security researchers at Malwarebytes and other firms confirmed the dataset's authenticity and widespread circulation on criminal forums, validating that 17.5 million users' privacy has been compromised regardless of the technical classification as \"breach\" versus \"scraping.\" The incident highlights the blurred lines between legitimate data collection and malicious harvesting, demonstrating how inadequate API protections can expose user data at massive scale without requiring sophisticated hacking techniques. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With no passwords directly leaked, the primary risks involve identity verification abuse, targeted phishing, account takeover attempts via social engineering, and SIM-swapping attacks leveraging the exposed phone numbers. </p> <p>Users whose data appears in the dataset face increased risk of spear-phishing emails, SMS phishing (smishing), voice phishing (vishing), and impersonation attacks across multiple platforms beyond Instagram. </p> <p>The incident underscores the critical importance of robust API security controls, rate limiting, behavioral analysis, and user data minimization in social media platforms managing hundreds of millions of user accounts.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/Instagram/#incident-specifications","title":"Incident Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Incident Type Data Leak, API Scraping, Mass Data Exposure Disclosure Date January 7, 2026 (published on dark web forums) Data Collection Period 2024 (alleged scraping operation timeframe) Affected Platform Instagram (Meta Platforms Inc.)

TA427, Emerald Sleet), a North Korean state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) of North Korea, has launched a sophisticated spear-phishing campaign leveraging malicious QR codes to evade traditional email security controls and exploit the security gap between enterprise email protections and personal mobile devices. </p> <p>This campaign represents a significant tactical evolution in phishing techniques, introducing what cybersecurity researchers call \"quishing\" (QR code + phishing)\u2014a method that bypasses conventional URL scanning, link analysis, and sandbox detonation employed by enterprise email gateways. </p> <p>The FBI issued a formal warning about these attacks, highlighting their effectiveness against government agencies, think tanks, policy research institutions, and academic organizations conducting research related to Korean Peninsula geopolitics, nuclear policy, and East Asian security. </p> <p>Unlike traditional phishing emails containing clickable URLs or malicious attachments that can be intercepted and analyzed by email security solutions, Kimsuky's emails contain embedded or attached QR code images that appear innocuous to automated scanning systems\u2014just a static image with no obvious malicious indicators. When a target scans the QR code using their personal smartphone or tablet (devices typically outside the protection of enterprise security controls), they are redirected through a multi-stage infrastructure of attacker-controlled domains that profile the victim's device (browser type, operating system, IP address, geographic location, language settings) before presenting a mobile-optimized credential-harvesting page designed to impersonate legitimate services such as Microsoft 365, Okta, Google Workspace, corporate VPN portals, or single sign-on (SSO) providers. </p> <p>The phishing pages are specifically optimized for mobile browsers, featuring responsive designs that adapt to small touchscreens, avoiding detection mechanisms that focus on desktop browser behaviors. Beyond simple credential theft, Kimsuky employs session token harvesting\u2014capturing authentication cookies and OAuth tokens that enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) bypass through token replay attacks, allowing attackers to authenticate to cloud services without triggering additional MFA prompts. Once access is obtained, Kimsuky establishes persistent presence in compromised accounts by creating inbox rules (auto-forward sensitive emails), application registrations (OAuth app permissions for ongoing access), and mailbox delegates (grant access to other compromised or attacker-controlled accounts).

The attack begins with meticulously crafted spear-phishing emails impersonating trusted cybersecurity organizations, government entities, or industry partners, often using themes related to \"cybersecurity guidelines,\" \"security updates,\" or \"urgent compliance notifications\" to create a false sense of legitimacy and urgency. </p> <p>Attached to these emails are malicious Microsoft Word documents (.docx, .doc) employing icon spoofing techniques to appear as legitimate PDF files, cybersecurity advisories, or official documents, combined with social engineering text that convinces victims to enable macros (a critical user action required for infection). Once macros are enabled, an embedded VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro executes, downloading and deploying the RustyWater RAT binary from attacker-controlled infrastructure. </p> <p></p> <p>The RAT establishes asynchronous command-and-control (C2) communication with domains such as nomercys.it[.]com, enabling the threat actor to maintain persistent remote access while evading network detection through irregular communication patterns. RustyWater incorporates advanced anti-analysis capabilities including debugger detection, virtual machine (VM) detection, and sandbox evasion, making it difficult for security researchers to analyze and for automated malware sandboxes to detonate. The malware achieves persistence by creating Windows Registry Run keys that ensure automatic execution at system startup, maintaining access even after system reboots. </p> <p>As a modular RAT platform, RustyWater provides operators with comprehensive post-compromise capabilities including system reconnaissance (OS version, security products, network configuration), file system operations (upload/download/execute), remote command execution, credential harvesting, and potential lateral movement across compromised networks. </p> <p>The campaign primarily targets diplomatic entities, government agencies, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and critical infrastructure operators in the Middle East region, aligning with Iran's strategic intelligence collection priorities. The use of Rust programming language represents a tactical advantage for MuddyWater, as Rust binaries are less commonly analyzed by security researchers compared to traditional C/C++ malware, and signature-based antivirus detection is less mature for Rust-compiled threats. </p> <p>Additionally, Rust's memory safety features reduce malware crashes, improving operational reliability during long-term espionage operations. This campaign highlights MuddyWater's continued evolution and adaptation, maintaining relevance as a formidable nation-state threat actor despite years of public exposure and threat intelligence reporting.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/RustyWater/#campaign-specifications","title":"Campaign Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Threat Actor MuddyWater (TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten, Mango Sandstorm, TA450) Attribution Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) Campaign Name RustyWater RAT Deployment Malware Family RustyWater RAT (also: Archer RAT, RUSTRIC) Malware Type Remote Access Trojan (RAT), Backdoor Programming Language Rust (compiled binary) Initial Access Vector Spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Word attachments Delivery Mechanism Malicious .docx/.doc files with VBA macros Execution Method User-initiated macro execution \u2192 VBA script \u2192 RustyWater binary deployment Persistence Mechanism Windows Registry Run keys (HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run) Command &amp;

The vulnerability stems from an unsafe DLL loading mechanism caused by improper use of the Windows LoadLibraryEx API function, which fails to adequately validate and sanitize DLL search paths. </p> <p>Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted network requests to the MsgReceiver service that trigger loading of malicious DLLs from attacker-controlled network locations or writable directories. Once the malicious DLL is loaded, it executes within the security context of the MsgReceiver.exe process, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM (the highest privilege level on Windows systems). </p> <p>With a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical), this vulnerability requires no authentication, no user interaction, and minimal attack complexity, making it an ideal target for opportunistic attackers scanning for exposed Apex Central instances or targeted threat actors seeking to compromise enterprise security infrastructure. </p> <p>Trend Micro Apex Central serves as the centralized management platform for Trend Micro endpoint security products (Deep Security, OfficeScan, Worry-Free Business Security) deployed across enterprise environments, managing security policies, threat intelligence, agent updates, and incident response for thousands of endpoints.

Telegram proxy links use the URL format <code>https://t.me/proxy?server=&lt;IP&gt;&amp;port=&lt;PORT&gt;&amp;secret=&lt;SECRET&gt;</code>, which users can share to quickly configure proxy connections without manual setup\u2014a feature particularly valuable for activists, journalists, and dissidents operating under government surveillance and internet restrictions. </p> <p>However, security researchers discovered that when a user on a mobile device (Android or iOS) taps a proxy link\u2014even unintentionally\u2014Telegram's mobile clients automatically perform a direct connection test to the specified proxy server to validate its availability before adding it to the proxy list or prompting the user. This automatic validation probe bypasses any configured proxies, VPNs, or Tor connections the user may have active, instead using the device's native network interface to send a test packet directly to the attacker-controlled server, thereby leaking the user's real public IP address to the malicious proxy operator. Attackers weaponize this behavior by disguising proxy links as seemingly innocuous elements within Telegram conversations\u2014embedding them behind clickable usernames (using Telegram's custom URL scheme for usernames that can secretly contain proxy parameters), channel invites, inline bot responses, profile pictures, or group join links\u2014tricking users into clicking without realizing they're interacting with a proxy configuration link. </p> <p>The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it requires no user authentication, no malware installation, and no permissions\u2014a single misclick instantly reveals the user's identity. For users relying on Telegram's anonymity features in high-risk environments (political dissidents in authoritarian regimes, whistleblowers, human rights activists, investigative journalists, opposition leaders), this IP leak represents a life-threatening deanonymization attack that can enable government surveillance, location tracking, targeted harassment, arrest, or physical harm. </p> <p>The vulnerability undermines Telegram's core privacy promise and affects hundreds of millions of mobile users who may unknowingly expose their real IP addresses through social engineering attacks, malicious channels, compromised groups, or coordinated disinformation campaigns that spread weaponized proxy links. </p> <p>Security researchers warn that state-sponsored actors, law enforcement, and surveillance agencies in authoritarian countries are actively exploiting this technique to deanonymize activists and track dissidents, with reports of Telegram groups in Russia, Iran, and Belarus distributing disguised proxy links to identify opposition movement participants. </p> <p>The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed as of January 2026, with Telegram acknowledging the issue and stating they plan to add user warnings when proxy links are clicked, but no fix has been deployed yet\u2014leaving millions of users vulnerable to ongoing exploitation. The attack requires minimal technical sophistication (attackers only need to set up a simple MTProto proxy server and log incoming connection attempts), making it accessible to script kiddies, doxxing groups, stalkers, and nation-state surveillance programs alike. </p> <p>Unlike traditional phishing or malware attacks, this IP leak is a design flaw in Telegram's mobile client networking logic, meaning users cannot protect themselves through traditional security measures\u2014even security-conscious users with VPNs, firewalls, and Tor are vulnerable if they use Telegram's mobile apps. </p> <p>The vulnerability does not affect Telegram Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux desktop clients), which handle proxy links differently, nor does it affect Telegram Web (browser-based version)\u2014the issue is exclusive to Android and iOS mobile apps, which represent the overwhelming majority of Telegram's user base. This disclosure comes amid growing concerns about Telegram's security practices, including ongoing debates about its encryption implementation, data retention policies, and cooperation with government requests\u2014further eroding user trust in the platform as a secure communication tool for sensitive use cases.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/telegram/#vulnerability-specifications","title":"Vulnerability Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Vulnerability Name Telegram Proxy One-Click IP Address Exposure Vulnerability Type Privacy leak, deanonymization, information disclosure Affected Software Telegram for Android, Telegram for iOS Affected Versions All versions as of January 2026 (including latest releases) Unaffected Platforms Telegram Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), Telegram Web Attack Vector Malicious MTProto proxy link embedded in messages, usernames, channels User Interaction Required (user must click disguised proxy link) Attack Complexity Low (requires only basic web server setup and social engineering) Privileges Required None (attacker needs no special access or permissions) Disclosure Date January 12, 2026 Public Exploit Yes (proof-of-concept demonstrated by security researchers) Patch Status No fix deployed; Telegram plans to add user warnings (timeline unclear) Workaround Available Partial (system-wide VPN can mitigate but not eliminate risk) Affected User Count Hundreds of millions (Telegram mobile users globally) Severity Assessment High for at-risk users (activists, journalists), Medium for general users Exploitation Status Active exploitation suspected in authoritarian countries Root Cause Mobile client performs direct proxy validation bypassing VPN/proxy layers Leaked Information User's real public IP address, approximate geolocation, ISP information Privacy Impact Deanonymization of users relying on anonymity for safety Threat Actors Nation-state surveillance, law enforcement, doxxing groups, stalkers Use Cases at Risk Political dissidents, whistleblowers, activists, journalists, LGBTQ+ users Telegram's Response Acknowledged issue, plans to add warnings, no timeline for fix Researcher Attribution Cybersecurity researchers (disclosed via Cybernews, security media)"},{"location":"2026/Week2/telegram/#technical-details","title":"Technical Details","text":""},{"location":"2026/Week2/telegram/#mtproto-proxy-feature-in-telegram","title":"MTProto Proxy Feature in Telegram","text":"<p>What is MTProto Proxy?</p> <p>MTProto is Telegram's proprietary encryption protocol for client-server communication.

The campaign, ongoing since at least 2020 and actively continuing through January 2026, demonstrates sophisticated tradecraft focused on long-term persistent access, signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection, and infrastructure hijacking for operational purposes. </p> <p>UAT-7290 (Unattributed Threat Actor 7290) specializes in compromising Linux-based edge networking equipment and core telecommunications infrastructure\u2014including routers, firewalls, VPN gateways, SSH jump servers, and network management systems\u2014that form the backbone of global telecommunications networks. Unlike typical financially-motivated cybercrime or ransomware operations, UAT-7290's objectives align with strategic intelligence collection and network surveillance in support of Chinese national security interests, particularly targeting regions of geopolitical importance to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), territorial disputes (South China Sea, India-China border), and strategic competition with Western telecommunications infrastructure. </p> <p>The group employs a modular malware ecosystem consisting of multiple custom Linux backdoors and toolsets deployed in coordinated stages: RushDrop (also known as ChronosRAT) serves as the initial dropper establishing first foothold, DriveSwitch functions as a secondary payload loader, SilentRaid (MystRodX) provides comprehensive remote access and control capabilities, and Bulbature transforms compromised systems into Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs)\u2014essentially proxy infrastructure that UAT-7290 reuses for anonymizing command-and-control (C2) communications, lateral movement across victim networks, and future campaign staging. </p> <p>The ORB technique is particularly sophisticated: once a telecom edge device is compromised and converted to an ORB, it becomes part of UAT-7290's permanent infrastructure, enabling the group to route traffic through legitimate telecommunications infrastructure (making attribution difficult) and maintain access even if the original victim organization implements security improvements on internal systems. Initial access vectors include exploitation of one-day vulnerabilities (publicly disclosed CVEs in networking equipment from vendors like Cisco, Juniper, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, targeting the window between patch release and enterprise deployment), SSH brute-force attacks against exposed management interfaces with weak credentials, and suspected supply chain compromises (pre-positioned access via compromised software updates or vendor relationships). UAT-7290's targeting is highly selective and strategic, focusing on telecommunications providers (mobile carriers, internet backbone providers, undersea cable operators), government communications infrastructure (ministries, military networks, intelligence agencies), defense contractors, and critical infrastructure operators (energy, transportation, utilities) in countries where China maintains active geopolitical and economic interests. </p> <p>The campaign's impact extends beyond traditional espionage: by compromising telecommunications infrastructure, UAT-7290 gains potential visibility into call detail records (CDRs), SMS metadata, internet traffic routing, VPN connections, and subscriber location data\u2014enabling mass surveillance, targeted monitoring of individuals of interest (dissidents, journalists, government officials, military personnel), economic espionage (trade secrets, contract negotiations), and strategic intelligence on regional political developments. The campaign employs advanced anti-detection and persistence techniques including rootkit-like hiding mechanisms (concealing malware in obscure system directories like <code>.pkgdb</code> disguised as package management files), encrypted C2 communications (custom protocols, DNS tunneling, HTTPS masquerading), living-off-the-land tactics (leveraging legitimate system binaries like <code>bash</code>, <code>ssh</code>, <code>curl</code> to minimize forensic footprints), and intermittent callback patterns (dormant periods to evade network anomaly detection). </p> <p>UAT-7290 also deploys Windows malware for targeted post-exploitation on administrative workstations, including ShadowPad (notorious modular backdoor used by multiple Chinese APT groups) and RedLeaves (BUGJUICE), indicating coordination with or shared toolsets from established Chinese cyber espionage units such as APT41 (Winnti), APT10 (Stone Panda), and APT27 (Emissary Panda). </p> <p>The telecommunications industry presents a particularly lucrative target for nation-state espionage: telecom providers sit at the nexus of global communications infrastructure, handling voice, data, and internet traffic for millions of subscribers, governments, and enterprises. Compromising a single major telecommunications provider can yield intelligence access equivalent to thousands of individual device compromises, and enables passive surveillance (simply monitoring traffic flowing through compromised network equipment without needing to infect individual endpoints). </p> <p>UAT-7290's multi-year persistence indicates the campaign's high value to Chinese intelligence priorities and the difficulty telecom defenders face in detecting and removing sophisticated Linux-based implants on edge networking devices (which often lack robust logging, security tooling, and are difficult to patch without service disruption). The Operational Relay Box (ORB) strategy is particularly concerning from a cybersecurity community perspective: compromised telecom infrastructure becomes persistent, resilient, and reusable attack infrastructure that can support not just UAT-7290's operations but potentially be shared across Chinese intelligence agencies or contracted offensive cyber units. </p> <p>ORBs enable traffic laundering (routing malicious traffic through legitimate telecom infrastructure to conceal attacker origin), infrastructure hijacking (turning victim assets into attacker assets), and long-term strategic positioning (maintaining access for future contingencies such as pre-positioning for cyberwarfare capabilities in the event of geopolitical conflict). This campaign highlights critical vulnerabilities in global telecommunications security posture: many edge networking devices run outdated firmware, have inadequate logging and monitoring, rely on weak authentication (default credentials, password-based SSH), lack Linux-compatible endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and are managed by small security teams unable to keep pace with sophisticated nation-state threats. For telecom providers in developing regions (South Asia, Southeastern Europe), resource constraints and competing operational priorities often result in delayed patching, insufficient security controls, and limited incident response capabilities\u2014creating ideal conditions for persistent APT campaigns like UAT-7290.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week2/uat/#campaign-specifications","title":"Campaign Specifications","text":"Attribute Details Threat Actor UAT-7290 (Unattributed Threat Actor 7290) Attribution China-linked (state-sponsored, likely PLA or Ministry of State Security) Campaign Type Long-term cyber-espionage targeting telecommunications infrastructure Campaign Timeline Active since at least 2020, ongoing through January 2026 Primary Target Geography South Asia , Southeast Asia Target Sectors Telecommunications providers, government communications, defense, critical infrastructure Target Organizations Mobile carriers, ISPs, undersea cable operators, government ministries, military networks, defense contractors Strategic Objectives Signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection, mass surveillance, economic espionage, strategic positioning Initial Access Vectors One-day vulnerability exploitation (networking equipment CVEs), SSH brute-force attacks, suspected supply chain compromise Primary OS Targeting Linux (edge networking devices, routers, firewalls, VPN gateways, SSH jump servers) Secondary OS Targeting Windows (administrative workstations, network management systems) Linux Malware Arsenal RushDrop/ChronosRAT (dropper), DriveSwitch (loader), SilentRaid/MystRodX (backdoor), Bulbature (ORB backdoor) Windows Malware Arsenal ShadowPad (modular backdoor), RedLeaves/BUGJUICE (RAT) Key Innovation Operational Relay Box (ORB) technique\u2014converting compromised infrastructure into persistent proxy/relay nodes C2 Infrastructure Multi-layered: Direct C2 servers, compromised ORBs as intermediaries, DNS tunneling, HTTPS masquerading Persistence Mechanisms Rootkit-like hiding (hidden directories), cron jobs, init scripts, SSH key injection Stealth Techniques Encrypted C2, intermittent callbacks, living-off-the-land binaries, process hiding Lateral Movement SSH pivoting via compromised jump servers, ORB-based traffic relaying Data Exfiltration Call detail records (CDRs), SMS metadata, VPN logs, network configurations, subscriber data Intelligence Value Mass surveillance capability, targeted monitoring, economic intelligence, strategic positioning for cyberwarfare Threat Actor Maturity Highly sophisticated (multi-year operations, modular malware, advanced persistence) Shared Tooling ShadowPad, RedLeaves used by multiple Chinese APT groups (APT41, APT10, APT27) Attribution Confidence High (infrastructure, tooling, targeting align with Chinese state interests) Geopolitical Context China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), India-China border tensions, South China Sea disputes, regional influence competition Discovery Source Cisco Talos Intelligence (January 2026 public disclosure) Campaign Codename None publicly assigned (referred to by threat actor ID: UAT-7290)"},{"location":"2026/Week2/uat/#technical-details","title":"Technical Details","text":""},{"location":"2026/Week2/uat/#target-infrastructure-telecommunications-edge-and-core-systems","title":"Target Infrastructure: Telecommunications Edge and Core Systems","text":"<p>What Makes Telecom Infrastructure Attractive to APTs?</p> <p>Telecommunications networks are strategic intelligence goldmines:</p> <pre><code>Telecom Infrastructure Value for Espionage:\n\n1.

The flaw's unauthenticated remote attack vector, combined with the potential for privilege escalation to root access, enables complete system compromise without requiring any user interaction or credentials. Evidence of active exploitation in the wild prompted CISA to add CVE-2026-20045 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.</p> <p>The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP requests processed by the web interface, a classic code injection weakness (CWE-94) that has plagued enterprise software for decades. Unlike typical authenticated RCE flaws, CVE-2026-20045's unauthenticated nature dramatically increases its exploitability and risk profile.

He clicks on a sponsored search result recommending \"NexShield \u2013 Advanced Web Guardian\" and installs it from the Chrome Web Store, trusting the professional appearance and fabricated ratings.</p> <p>Extension Installation The extension behaves normally for 60 minutes after installation, displaying fake ad-blocking statistics to build trust. During this dormancy period, it secretly schedules an activation timer while Michael continues his work unaware.</p> <p>Browser Crash - Delayed Activation Exactly 60 minutes after installation, the extension triggers a coordinated denial-of-service attack, exhausting system memory and CPU resources. Michael's browser becomes unresponsive, consuming over 8GB of RAM before he's forced to terminate Chrome through Task Manager.</p> <p>Fake Security Warning Upon restarting Chrome, Michael immediately sees a professional-looking security warning claiming his browser crashed due to critical security issues. The warning instructs him to press Windows+R and paste a \"repair command\" that has been automatically copied to his clipboard. The warning appears legitimate, mentioning the NexShield extension he just installed.</p> <p>Command Execution - Social Engineering Success Trusting the official-looking warning and believing it will fix his crashed browser, Michael follows the instructions. He opens the Windows Run dialog and pastes the clipboard contents, which contains a complex PowerShell command disguised as a security repair. Despite the command's complexity, Michael executes it, believing it's necessary to restore browser functionality.</p> <p>Malware Deployment - ModeloRAT Installation The PowerShell command downloads and installs ModeloRAT, a remote access trojan targeting domain-joined systems. The malware verifies Michael's computer is connected to the corporate domain before proceeding. It establishes persistence through Registry entries and scheduled tasks disguised as legitimate Windows updates, then connects to attacker infrastructure over encrypted channels. Michael sees a success message indicating his browser is \"now secure\" with no visible signs of compromise.</p> <p>Attacker Reconnaissance The attackers gain access to Michael's IT Support account and begin mapping the corporate network. They discover his account has elevated privileges on workstations due to IT Support group membership. Through reconnaissance commands, they identify the domain structure, locate 2,487 domain users, discover the domain controller, and identify Domain Admin accounts. The attackers recognize this as a high-value compromise with clear paths to escalation.</p> <p>Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement Over the following days, attackers exploit Michael's IT Support privileges to move laterally across the network. They access the IT department file server and discover an Excel spreadsheet containing Domain Admin credentials stored in plain text. Using these harvested credentials, they gain complete control over the Active Directory environment, compromising 15 additional workstations and exfiltrating 4.2GB of sensitive data including credentials, network diagrams, and employee information.</p> <p>Discovery and Incident Response After 11 days, the security team detects suspicious PowerShell activity through endpoint detection tools. Forensic analysis reveals the full scope of the breach: ModeloRAT installed on 16 systems, 37 user passwords compromised, 2 Domain Admin accounts breached, and extensive data exfiltration. The incident response requires isolating affected systems, resetting all compromised credentials including a forced domain-wide password reset, removing the malicious extension across all browsers, and rebuilding 16 systems from clean images. The total incident cost reaches $340,000 including forensics, system rebuilds, productivity loss, and security tool upgrades.

The primary vulnerability (CVE-2026-0723) stems from an unchecked return value in GitLab's authentication services, allowing attackers with knowledge of a victim's credential ID to submit forged WebAuthn device responses that circumvent multi-factor authentication requirements. Additional vulnerabilities in the same patch cycle enable denial-of-service attacks targeting GitLab instances, creating availability risks for development teams relying on GitLab for version control, continuous integration, and DevOps workflows.</p> <p>GitLab serves as the backbone infrastructure for over 30 million registered users across 100,000+ organizations, managing source code repositories, automated testing and deployment pipelines, container registries, and security scanning workflows. The platform's central role in software development lifecycles\u2014from initial code commits to production deployments\u2014makes it a high-value target for threat actors seeking to inject malicious code into software supply chains, steal intellectual property, or disrupt critical development operations. Two-factor authentication represents a cornerstone security control protecting GitLab accounts from credential stuffing, phishing, and password spray attacks; vulnerabilities enabling 2FA bypass fundamentally undermine this protection layer.</p> <p>The CVE-2026-0723 authentication bypass vulnerability exploits improper handling of WebAuthn authentication flows, specifically when processing device credential responses during the second factor verification stage. GitLab's authentication logic fails to properly validate return values from WebAuthn operations, allowing attackers to craft forged responses that the system incorrectly accepts as valid second-factor proof. The attack requires knowledge of a target user's credential ID\u2014a value that, while not secret in the traditional sense, can be obtained through social engineering, OSINT reconnaissance of public repositories, or exploitation of information disclosure vulnerabilities.

The strategic value was amplified by the timing\u2014during nationwide internet blackouts, state television remained one of the few mass communication channels accessible to Iranian citizens.</p> <p>The reconnaissance phase involved identifying satellite uplink facility locations in Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad, researching the uplink equipment and broadcast chain infrastructure, and potentially identifying insiders through open-source intelligence gathering.</p> <p>Access Acquisition</p> <p>While the exact method has not been publicly confirmed, several scenarios are plausible. The attackers may have recruited or coerced an IRIB technician or satellite uplink operator with legitimate credentials and access to uplink facilities, motivated by political opposition or ideological alignment. Alternatively, physical infiltration through social engineering\u2014posing as equipment maintenance personnel with fake credentials\u2014could have provided entry during vulnerable periods. A third possibility involves remote compromise through exploitation of weak authentication on uplink control systems or exposed remote management access.</p> <p>Content Preparation</p> <p>The activists prepared approximately 10 minutes of pre-recorded material consisting of anti-government protest footage from recent demonstrations in Tehran and Isfahan, a recorded video appeal by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, text overlays with protest slogans, and direct appeals calling for military and security forces to defect from the regime.</p> <p>Signal Injection Execution</p> <p>On January 18, 2026, during prime viewing hours at 8:00 PM Tehran time, the hijacking was executed. The perpetrator gained access to the uplink control room and connected pre-recorded content to the video encoder, then configured the video router to switch from the legitimate IRIB feed to the rogue source.</p> <p>Iranian households tuned to state television channels suddenly saw protest footage instead of regular programming. Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi appeared on screen, urging military and security forces not to fire on protesters and calling for continued demonstrations for democracy and human rights. Additional protest clips showed crowds chanting anti-regime slogans with text overlays reading \"Rise up Iran\" and \"Mahsa Amini - We will not forget.\"</p> <p>After approximately 10 minutes, IRIB control room staff realized the hijacking and initiated emergency protocols. The uplink facility was locked down, the rogue video source was removed, and regular programming was restored.</p> <p>Amplification &amp; Propaganda Value</p> <p>The opposition immediately leveraged the successful hijacking for maximum propaganda value. Diaspora activists recorded the hijacked broadcast and uploaded footage to social media platforms within minutes, generating millions of views within hours. International media outlets including BBC Persian, Voice of America, and Western news organizations covered the story extensively.</p> <p>The incident demonstrated the regime's inability to secure its own infrastructure, broke the information monopoly during internet blackouts, emboldened protesters by proving that opposition could challenge state power, and raised morale among activists inside Iran.</p> <p>Government Response</p> <p>Iranian authorities likely responded with immediate emergency lockdowns of all satellite uplink facilities, replacement of credentials for uplink equipment access, investigations of potential insider threats, and increased physical security measures. Technical remediation probably included implementing real-time broadcast monitoring, adding encryption to uplink signals, deploying multi-factor authentication, and network segmentation to isolate critical systems.</p> <p>Publicly, state media either downplayed the incident or blamed \"foreign interference\" with no official acknowledgment of the security breach. Internally, authorities likely increased surveillance of IRIB employees and contractors while tightening media censorship and information control.</p> <p>Strategic Assessment</p> <p>For the opposition, the operation successfully demonstrated regime vulnerability and undermined the perception of state invincibility through psychological warfare. It provided inspiration for future information warfare tactics and generated significant global media attention for Iranian protests.</p> <p>For the regime, the incident exposed critical infrastructure security gaps, resulted in loss of information monopoly during a crucial blackout period, and created the risk of copycat attacks while requiring increased resources for information

SEO Poisoning Infrastructure Setup Attackers compromise 50 WordPress sites with outdated plugins and weak credentials, installing fake document repository pages. These malicious pages are optimized for high-value search terms like \"business contract template 2026,\" \"employment agreement template,\" and \"real estate purchase agreement form.\" Using black hat SEO techniques including keyword stuffing, backlink networks, and search engine manipulation, the malicious pages achieve first-page Google rankings.</p> <p>2. Target User Profile Sarah K., a legal assistant at a mid-sized law firm, searches for \"real estate purchase agreement template 2026.\" Among the top Google results, a malicious site ranking second appears legitimate alongside authentic sources like the National Association of Realtors and LegalZoom. Sarah clicks the malicious link, trusting its high search ranking.</p> <p>3. Malicious Download Page The compromised website displays a professional-looking page offering a \"comprehensive, attorney-reviewed real estate purchase agreement template.\" The page features fabricated user ratings and a prominent download button. When Sarah clicks to download the template, her browser downloads a 47 MB ZIP file named \"Real_Estate_Purchase_Agreement_2026.zip.\"</p> <p>4. ZIP Extraction Sarah double-clicks the downloaded ZIP file in her Downloads folder. Windows Explorer's built-in ZIP handler successfully extracts the malformed archive, displaying a single file: \"Real_Estate_Purchase_Agreement_2026.js\" (437 KB). Unfamiliar with the .js extension but trusting the file came from her search, Sarah proceeds to extract the file to her Desktop.</p> <p>5. User Execution Sarah double-clicks the extracted JavaScript file expecting a document to open. Windows automatically associates .js files with Windows Script Host, which silently executes the malicious payload without any user prompt or warning. The JavaScript file displays a Windows Script Host icon resembling a document, reinforcing Sarah's assumption that it's legitimate.</p> <p>6. PowerShell Stage Execution The JavaScript payload deobfuscates and launches a hidden PowerShell process with execution policy bypassed. PowerShell downloads a second-stage script from the attacker's command-and-control server, which enumerates system information including hostname, domain, and antivirus software. The script then downloads a Cobalt Strike beacon and injects it directly into memory using reflective DLL injection techniques.</p> <p>7. Persistence Establishment The malware establishes multiple persistence mechanisms to survive system reboots. It creates a Windows Registry Run key pointing to a renamed copy of the JavaScript payload stored in the Temp directory with an innocuous name like \"svchost.js.\" Additionally, it places a shortcut in the Windows Startup folder to ensure execution every time Sarah logs in.</p> <p>8. Cobalt Strike C2 Established The attacker's Cobalt Strike server receives a new beacon connection from Sarah's laptop, providing the hostname, domain (LAWFIRM.LOCAL), user account, operating system details, and active antivirus status. The attacker begins issuing commands to enumerate domain users (247 accounts discovered) and identify domain administrators (4 accounts found), all while Windows Defender remains enabled but fails to detect the in-memory beacon.</p> <p>9. Post-Exploitation &amp; Lateral Movement Over 15 days, the attacker conducts extensive reconnaissance, mapping network shares and enumerating Active Directory. On day 4, they exploit an unpatched PrintNightmare vulnerability on the print server to gain SYSTEM privileges and dump credentials from memory, harvesting 12 domain user passwords and 1 domain admin password hash. Using pass-the-hash techniques with the domain admin credentials, they access the domain controller and file server, ultimately exfiltrating 45 GB of sensitive data including confidential client case files, financial records, and employee personal information.

With a CVSS score of 9.9, this flaw represents one of the most severe security issues affecting Zoom's on-premises infrastructure, potentially exposing thousands of enterprise and government conference rooms to remote code execution attacks.</p> <p>Zoom Node MMRs serve as critical middleware in enterprise video conferencing architectures, connecting legacy video endpoints (Cisco, Polycom, Lifesize room systems) to Zoom meetings and managing media transcoding, encryption, and routing for hybrid participants. These appliances typically reside within corporate DMZs or conference room VLANs, processing sensitive audio and video streams for board meetings, client presentations, legal proceedings, and classified government briefings. The command injection vulnerability stems from improper input validation when processing meeting participant data, allowing attackers to inject OS-level commands that execute with the privileges of the MMR's application process\u2014often running as root or system administrator on Linux-based appliances.</p> <p>The attack vector requires only that an attacker join a Zoom meeting using a vulnerable MMR as a bridge for room system participants.

The attackers extracted credentials from MMR configuration files and scanned the internal network to map additional infrastructure targets.</p> <p>Phase 4: Long-Term Surveillance &amp; Data Exfiltration</p> <p>Over 12 weeks, the compromised MMR provided LegalLeaks with unprecedented access to the law firm's confidential communications. The attackers intercepted 342 attorney-client privileged meetings across 3 major cases, exfiltrated 89 GB of meeting recordings, and captured 1,247 confidential documents screen-shared during meetings. Client communications, email credentials, and VPN access were harvested from conference room laptops.</p> <p>Specific high-value intelligence included the complete pharmaceutical patent litigation strategy with settlement parameters, internal investigation findings for the securities fraud defense, and technical specifications of proprietary autonomous driving algorithms from the trade secret case.</p> <p>The threat actors monetized the intercepted intelligence by selling information to opposing counsel through anonymous intermediaries (\\(2.8M), hedge funds for insider trading on settlement announcements (\\)4.5M profit), and competitive intelligence firms serving client adversaries ($1.3M).</p> <p>Phase 5: Detection &amp; Response</p> <p>After 12 weeks, Whitmore's IT Security team discovered the breach when network monitoring flagged unusual outbound HTTPS traffic from the MMR to an unknown domain. Investigation revealed suspicious system services not present in baseline configurations and meeting recording implants. Forensic analysis uncovered root-level persistence across 4 Zoom Node MMRs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston offices, with continuous surveillance capturing 342 privileged attorney-client meetings and complete exfiltration of video files and credentials.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week3/zoom/#impact-assessment","title":"Impact Assessment","text":""},{"location":"2026/Week3/zoom/#enterprise-risk-profile","title":"Enterprise Risk Profile","text":"<p>CVE-2026-22844 presents severe risks to organizations relying on Zoom Node MMR infrastructure for hybrid conferencing:</p> Technical ImpactBusiness ImpactSector-Specific Risks <ul> <li>Complete System Compromise: Root-level command execution enables full control of MMR appliances</li> <li>Meeting Interception: Real-time access to audio/video streams of confidential meetings</li> <li>Credential Theft: Extraction of VPN credentials, service account passwords, API keys from MMR configuration</li> <li>Lateral Movement: Compromised MMRs serve as pivot points into conference room VLANs and corporate networks</li> <li>Persistent Access: Backdoors survive reboots and basic security scanning</li> <li>Supply Chain Risk: Multi-tenant MMR deployments expose multiple organizations through single vulnerability</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Confidentiality Breach: Exposure of board meetings, M&amp;A negotiations, legal strategy sessions, financial planning</li> <li>Competitive Intelligence Loss: Adversaries gain access to product roadmaps, pricing strategies, partnership discussions</li> <li>Regulatory Non-Compliance: Violations of attorney-client privilege, HIPAA (telehealth), ITAR (defense contractors)</li> <li>Reputational Damage: Loss of client trust following disclosure of meeting surveillance</li> <li>Operational Disruption: Emergency patching and infrastructure replacement causing conferencing outages</li> <li>Financial Losses: Incident response costs, litigation disadvantages, lost contracts, regulatory fines</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Legal: Attorney-client privilege breaches, litigation strategy exposure, malpractice claims</li> <li>Healthcare: HIPAA violations from telehealth meeting interceptions, patient privacy breaches</li> <li>Financial Services: SEC violations for M&amp;A intelligence leaks, insider trading facilitation</li> <li>Defense: ITAR violations from classified meeting surveillance, espionage risks</li> <li>Government: Classified information exposure, espionage, policy decision intelligence</li> <li>Enterprise: Trade secret theft, competitive intelligence losses, board meeting surveillance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2026/Week3/zoom/#meeting-confidentiality-compromise","title":"Meeting Confidentiality Compromise","text":"<p>Zoom Node MMRs process highly sensitive communications across diverse organizational contexts:</p> <p>High-Value Meeting Types at Risk:</p> <ul> <li>Executive Board Meetings: Strategic planning, financial performance, executive compensation, succession planning</li> <li>Legal Consultations: Attorney-client privileged discussions, litigation strategies, settlement negotiations</li> <li>M&amp;A Negotiations: Deal terms, due diligence findings, valuation discussions, integration planning</li> <li>Healthcare Consultations: Telehealth sessions, patient diagnosis discussions, treatment planning</li> <li>Government Deliberations: Policy decisions, classified briefings, diplomatic negotiations</li> <li>Financial Planning: Investment strategies, trading discussions, client portfolio reviews</li> </ul> <p>Threat Actor Interest:</p> <ul> <li>Corporate Espionage: Competitors seeking trade secrets, product roadmaps, pricing strategies</li> <li>Nation-State APTs: Intelligence agencies targeting government communications, defense contractor meetings</li> <li>Financially Motivated: Insider trading schemes leveraging M&amp;A intelligence, earnings preview leaks</li> <li>Litigation Adversaries: Opposing parties gaining strategic advantages from intercepted legal strategy sessions</li> <li>Activist Investors: Hedge funds seeking advance knowledge of corporate strategy, financial performance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2026/Week3/zoom/#mitigation-strategies","title":"Mitigation Strategies","text":""},{"location":"2026/Week3/zoom/#immediate-actions-emergency-response","title":"Immediate Actions (Emergency Response)","text":"<p>Priority 1: Patch Deployment</p> <p>Organizations must immediately upgrade all Zoom Node MMR appliances to version 5.2.1716.0 or later.

discovered in the Telnet daemon (telnetd) component of GNU InetUtils, a suite of common networking utilities maintained by the GNU Project. This 11-year-old vulnerability, present in the codebase since 2014 but only recently identified in 2026, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain root shell access on vulnerable systems by exploiting improper handling of the USER environment variable during the authentication handshake. The flaw enables complete system compromise without requiring any credentials, making it one of the most severe authentication bypass vulnerabilities affecting Unix-like operating systems in recent years.</p> <p>GNU InetUtils provides fundamental networking tools including telnet, telnetd, ftp, ftpd, rsh, rshd, rlogin, rlogind, tftp, tftpd, talk, talkd, inetd, ping, traceroute, hostname, dnsdomainname, ifconfig, and logger. The telnetd daemon specifically implements the server-side Telnet protocol (RFC 854) for remote terminal access, historically used for system administration before SSH became the standard secure alternative. Despite Telnet's well-known security weaknesses\u2014including transmission of credentials in plaintext and lack of encryption\u2014telnetd remains deployed on legacy systems, embedded devices, industrial control systems, network equipment, and enterprise environments where compatibility with vintage software is required.</p> <p>The vulnerability stems from telnetd's failure to sanitize user-supplied environment variables before passing them to the system's login(1) program. When a remote attacker connects with a specially crafted USER environment variable value of \"-f root\" (using Telnet's --login or -a automatic login flags), telnetd forwards this unsanitized input directly to /usr/bin/login. The login program interprets the \"-f\" flag as a trusted login bypass option originally intended for use by privileged local processes, granting immediate root shell access without password verification. This design flaw represents a catastrophic failure in security boundary enforcement between network-exposed services and privileged system authentication mechanisms.</p> <p>The vulnerability affects GNU InetUtils versions 1.9.3 through 2.7, spanning an 11-year period from 2014 to 2025. Security researchers estimate that tens of thousands of systems globally remain vulnerable, including embedded devices, legacy Unix servers, industrial SCADA systems, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls), and containerized environments where telnetd has been inadvertently included. Evidence of active exploitation emerged within hours of public disclosure, with mass scanning campaigns targeting TCP port 23 and automated exploitation frameworks integrating CVE-2026-24061 payloads. The combination of trivial exploitation (requiring only standard telnet client tools), unauthenticated remote root access, and widespread deployment across diverse system types creates an urgent remediation imperative for organizations maintaining any Telnet-enabled infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"2026/Week4/gnu/#vulnerability-specifications","title":"Vulnerability Specifications","text":"Attribute Details CVE ID CVE-2026-24061 Vulnerability Type Remote Authentication Bypass CWE Classification CWE-287: Improper Authentication Affected Software GNU InetUtils telnetd (Telnet Daemon) Vulnerable Versions 1.9.3 through 2.7 (2014-2025, 11-year vulnerability window) Fixed Version 2.8 and later Attack Vector Network (Remote) Attack Complexity Low (Single command, standard Telnet client) Privileges Required None (Unauthenticated) User Interaction None Scope Changed (Complete System Compromise) Confidentiality Impact High (Full root access to all files) Integrity Impact High (Complete system control) Availability Impact High (System shutdown, service disruption) CVSS 3.1 Base Score 9.8 (Critical) Public Disclosure Date January 2026 Patch Availability GNU InetUtils 2.8 (January 2026) Exploitation Status Active Exploitation Confirmed (Mass Scanning Observed)"},{"location":"2026/Week4/gnu/#technical-details","title":"Technical Details","text":""},{"location":"2026/Week4/gnu/#telnet-protocol-and-authentication-flow","title":"Telnet Protocol and Authentication Flow","text":"<p>The Telnet protocol (defined in RFC 854) provides bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication over TCP.
