    A ransomware attack on the University of Mississippi Medical Center forced the closure of all 35 outpatient clinics statewide and canceled elective procedures for multiple days. The attack encrypted the Epic EHR platform, phones, email, and critical IT systems, forcing UMMC to shut down its network and operate hospitals using manual paper-based procedures.

    Detected on February 19, 2026, the attack demonstrates the severe operational impact ransomware can have on healthcare delivery across an entire state network. Attackers made contact with ransom demands while UMMC works with FBI, CISA, and DHS to investigate the intrusion, restore systems, and determine if patient protected health information was compromised.

    **Spitting Cash: ATM Jackpotting Attacks Surged in 2025**

    ATM jackpotting attacks surged dramatically in 2025, with the FBI recording over 700 incidents causing $20+ million in losses. Attackers use Ploutus malware combined with physical access via generic master keys to force Windows-based ATMs to dispense cash without legitimate transactions. The attacks target the ATM's cash-dispenser APIs directly, bypassing normal banking flows.

    A DOJ case indicted 54 individuals linked to Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua for 117 jackpotting attempts causing $5.4M in losses. The attacks exploit weak physical security, legacy Windows systems, and commoditized malware tools that enable low-skill crews to execute rapid cash-outs in under 10 minutes per machine.
