    **Fortinet FortiClientEMS Critical SQL Injection (CVE-2026-21643)**

    **CVE-2026-21643**{.cve-chip} **SQL Injection**{.cve-chip} **Unauthenticated**{.cve-chip} **Remote Code Execution**{.cve-chip} **Fortinet**{.cve-chip}

    A critical SQL injection in FortiClientEMS 7.4.4 allows unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests to the admin interface and execute arbitrary SQL. The flaw can lead to remote code execution and compromise of the EMS management server.

    Because FortiClientEMS centrally manages endpoints, a successful compromise can cascade into wider enterprise risk. Upgrading to 7.4.5 or later and restricting admin interface exposure are key mitigations.

    **UNC3886 Cyber Espionage Campaign Against Singapore Telcos**

    **Cyber Espionage**{.cve-chip} **Telecommunications**{.cve-chip} **Zero-Day Exploitation**{.cve-chip} **Rootkits**{.cve-chip} **National Security**{.cve-chip}

    Singapore’s CSA and IMDA reported a prolonged UNC3886 espionage campaign targeting telecom networks. Attackers exploited a firewall zero-day, deployed rootkits for stealth persistence, and exfiltrated limited technical network data without disrupting core services.

    While no customer data was exposed and core 5G infrastructure remained segmented, the incident prompted a major national cyber response due to the strategic risk posed to critical infrastructure.
