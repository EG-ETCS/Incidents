    **Amazon: AI-Assisted Hacker Breached 600 Fortinet Firewalls in 5 Weeks**

    **AI-Assisted Attack**{.cve-chip} **Credential Abuse**{.cve-chip} **FortiGate Firewalls**{.cve-chip} **Financially Motivated**{.cve-chip}

    A Russian-speaking threat actor with limited technical skills used multiple commercial generative AI services to breach over 600 FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. Amazon's CISO described the operation as an "AI-powered assembly line for cybercrime," where AI tools handled reconnaissance, scripting, attack planning, and tooling development.

    Crucially, no Fortinet vulnerability was exploited—attacks relied on exposed management interfaces, weak passwords, and lack of MFA. AI services generated attack scripts, analyzed stolen configurations, and guided lateral movement, demonstrating how AI drastically lowers the skill barrier for sophisticated cyber campaigns.

    **Fake IPTV Apps Spread Massiv Android Malware Targeting Mobile Banking Users**

    **Android Banking Trojan**{.cve-chip} **Mobile Malware**{.cve-chip} **IPTV Lure**{.cve-chip} **Device Takeover**{.cve-chip}

    Massiv is a sophisticated Android banking trojan disguised as fake IPTV streaming apps, targeting users in Portugal, Spain, France, and Turkey. It abuses Android Accessibility Services to enable keylogging, screen overlays, and two remote-control modes: live screen streaming via MediaProjection API and advanced UI-tree extraction that bypasses screen-capture protections.

    Active for 8+ months with upward trends, Massiv enables attackers to steal banking credentials, conduct real-time fraudulent transactions, and open new accounts in victims' names. The malware also targets Portugal's Chave Móvel Digital national authentication system, enabling full identity theft and financial fraud at the national e-ID level.
